    "developing new code.  To recap, all interactions that function with Cisco Viptela Vmanage should be contained within the viptela.py file, all methods to deal with data retrieved from the vManage API should go in helpers.py, and tie it all together in config_sync.py. If you need to add configuration data, it can be added into the viptela.cfg file.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That's all there is to getting started here.  Now let's move on to add some functionality to the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discover all devices in vManage and print output to the console\n",
    "For this first exercise you will be adding one of the workflows included in the framework, gathering all devices from the vManage orchestrator. The workflow we will be creating is to create both a viptela module that will pull all devices, and a helper module that will take that device info and parse it into a table to display on CLI.  The viptela function will be housed within the ViptelaClient class within viptela.py, and the print table module will be in the helpers.py file.  You will then add the instructions to config_sync to tell it to gather the data from the new Viptela class, and then pass that data to the new helper class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 - Open Pycharm on Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - Open ViptelaClient project\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3 - Open file /Labs/lab01/config_sync.py, /Labs/lab01/viptela.py, and /Labs/lab01/helpers.py in Pycharm tabs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 - Review API Reference for the Viptela SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "https://python-viptela.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to interact with the Devices module, so click on the api link and then choose api.device.  Two things to note here are the class details highlighted in blue, and the functions wihhch are bolded in grey boxes below.  The very first module, get_device_list(self, category), is the module you will be interacting with with.  We must instantiate a copy of this class using the parameters required in the blue box and then call the appropriate function, get_device_list for the results.  The parameters that it accepts are either vedges or controllers, and it will return our data as a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 - viptela.py - import the 'Devices' module \n",
    "\n",
    "To use this piece of the Python SDK, we first have to import the the module into our viptela.py file.  Add the following as the last line in the import statements at the top of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from vmanage.api.device import Device\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Step 6 - viptela.py - create new module in ViptelaClient class\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the module is imported, we can begin to interact with the module within our ViptelaClass.  Go to the viptela.py file, and scroll to the bottom of the file, which should be right below 'def login_sdk(self):'.  We are going to add our new function here which will be called form within config_sync.py. Copy the code snippet below into the file in Pycharm.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function within viptela.py should do three things.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Instantiate the Device class we just imported using settings we already have because we instantiated ViptelaClient.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Send the 'type' of device we get (either vedges or controllers) to the get_device_list function in the Viptela SDK and save that data to a variable called device_list\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Return device_list\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def get_devices_list(self, type):\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "        Get devices uses the Viptela Device API to fetch the list of devices\n",
    "        either vedges or controllers and returns them in a list of dictionaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "        :param type: Either 'vedges' or 'controllers'\n",
    "        :return:\n",
    "            result (list): Device list\n",
    "        '''\n",
    "\n",
    "        # Instantiate new device object to use the Device library\n",
    "        device = Device(self.session, self.host, port=self.port)\n",
    "        # Request list of all devices by type specified and store in variable\n",
    "        device_list = device.get_device_list(type)\n",
    "        return device_list\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7 - config_sync.py - Call the new viptela function\n",
    "\n",
    "The function has been defined in viptela.py but we need to update config_sync.py to launch that function.  To keep code as readable and reusable as possible we are going to split this into two tasks.  First, create a new function under ConfigSync class that will bundle all of the requests together and return the data.  Second, call that function from under the \"if __name__ == '__main__'\" section of the script.  To avoid any confusion between the function name in ConfigSync and the function name in ViptelaClient, prepend all ConfigSync functions with cs_.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create the function cs_get_all_device_info and gather info for both vedges and controllers.  Return the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    def cs_get_all_device_info(self):\n",
    "        vedges = self.viptela.get_devices_list('vedges')\n",
    "        controllers = self.viptela.get_devices_list('controllers')\n",
    "        return vedges, controllers\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Call that function from under the \"if __name__ == '__main__'\".  With this one call, store both vedge and controller data when it is returned.  We will use these list independently to perform different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    # Get Device info for vedges and controllers\n",
    "    vedge_list, controller_list = cs.cs_get_all_device_info()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 8 - Pycharm - Debug the code\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happens when we launch the script and step through it.  If you were to run the code fully, it would process but not shot any output.  To debug the code we have to set a break point, and then step through the code using either F8 (next step) or F7 (step into).  If we get in too deep in our steps, we can step out with Shift + F8.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As you are debugging, pay attention to the Debugger window at the bottom.  It will contain all variables currently in memory at that step.  Debugging is a great way to understand exactly what data and in what formats are we receiving from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set a breakpoint\n",
    "\n",
    "Set breakpoint in the last line by clicking on the line number.  A red dot should appear beside it as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Set Breakpoint](images/lab01-001-debug_breakpoint_1.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Launch Labs/lab01/config_sync.py from within Pycharm in DEBUG mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Right click on the file in the Project Explorer and choose 'DEBUG config_sync.py'.  This will launch us into DEBUG mode, start executing the application, and stop when it hits our DEBUG line.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Step INTO our functions\n",
    "\n",
    "From the breakpoint if we hit F7 it will step INTO that line, meaning it will go to the function/module that is being called.  Go ahead and hit F7 and it should take us to 'def cs_get_all_device_info'.  At this point nothing has executed in this function, we have just been moved into it.  Now press F7 again to step INTO this function.  It will take us to Labs/lab01/viptela.py at the function 'def get_devices_list'.  Again nothing has executed yet, we are just sitting at the first line.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Step INTO the vManage SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "To sneak a little farther under the hood, go ahead and press F7 one more time here.  This will take us to the devices.py file, which is part of the vManage SDK. Notice that we are in the __init__ function which is automatic when instantiating a new class.  Go ahead and step through here with F8 - 3 times.  Notice as you press F8 a grey variable pops up to the right of each line.  This is how Pycharm shows us where a variable has been assigned, and what the value is.  We could also look in the variables list below and see these details.  NOTE:  Variables change as we step through programs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "If you press F8 one more time, it will finish the last step in __init__ and send us back to our function in viptela.py.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Step INTO the vManage SDK again\n",
    "\n",
    "Press F8 once more and it should move us down to the function call 'device_list = device.get_device_list(type)'.  Press F7 on this line to step INTO the devices.py once more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice we are now in the 'def get_device_list' function within devices.py.  We have passed a variable for category with our value being 'vedges'.  Notice how simple and clean even this portion of the SDK is.  We construct a URL, make a REST call, parse the data, and then return it to the function that called.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Go ahead and step OVER three (3) of these events by pressing F8.  This should leave you on the line 'return results'.  Take a look at 'response' and 'result' in the DEBUGGER window at the bottom of your screen.  NOTE:  The data included in results can be found in the REST response under response{'json'}{'data'}.  Reviewing this data tells us exactly what type of format the return results are in, as well as allows us to dig into those results to understand what variables, values, etc are in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Follow the data results\n",
    "\n",
    "Step OUT by pressing F8 one more time.  This will complete the function and return the results. Press F8 once more to step OVER and to the final line which is 'return device_list'.  Note how the same data in the response is now in the device_list variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Press F8 again to step OVER and finish this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Step OUT and finish script\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to step around in this application as much as you want to, but it is not necessary for us to finish what we are doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To step OUT press Shift + F8 **twice** and the program will complete.  Note that nothing else happens because we haven't done anything with the data yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9 - helpers.py - Import necessary modules to helpers.py\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to format the output of the results we are going to use a module called 'tabulate'.  Import this module into the helpers.py file at the top of the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import tabulate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10 - helpers.py - Create new function in helpers.py to print the device data to screen\n",
    "\n",
    "Add the following code snippet into helpers.py.  The function will take the input devices_list, create a list for headers based on the fields we will be pulling out of the data set.
